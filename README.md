# Example App for the Scanbot Capacitor Barcode Scanner SDK with the Ionic framework

This example app demonstrates how to integrate the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK into your Capacitor app.

## What is the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK?

The Scanbot [Barcode Scanner SDK](https://scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites) is a simple and intuitive plugin that allows you to turn smartphones into fast and reliable barcode scanners.

It operates entirely offline on the user's device and takes only 0.04 seconds to scan barcodes. Scans are accurate even under challenging conditions, including damaged, small, or distant barcodes and low-light environments.

The plugin can be integrated into your app within minutes and comes with Ready-To-Use UI components, which allow you to customize the barcode scanner to your needs.

ðŸ’¡ For more details about the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Capacitor, please check out our [documentation](https://docs.scanbot.io/barcode-scanner-sdk/capacitor/introduction/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites).

## Requirements

* NodeJS 18+ & npm
* [Capacitor CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capacitor/cli) 6+
* For Android apps:
	* Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1+
	* Android SDK (API Level 22+), Platforms and Developer Tools

* For iOS apps:
	* iOS 13+
	* macOS with Xcode 15+
	* Xcode Command Line Tools
	* Homebrew
	* Cocoapods

Please check the full [requirements for Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup).

## How to run the example app

### Step 1: Install

Install the node modules of this project:

```
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build

Build the web assets and sync with the Capacitor native projects:

```
npm run build
npm run sync
```

### Step 3: Run

Connect an Android or iOS device via USB and run the app by opening the respective projects, or via the terminal with these commands:

```
npm run android
```

```
npm run ios
```

You can read more about the Capacitor CLI commands at this [link](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/cli).

If you want to develop without Capacitor CLI commands, you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) together with the [Ionic VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionic.ionic). Read more about this [here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/vscode/getting-started).

**Note:**Â Please make sure that you have configured the camera permissions accordingly.

## Features of the Capacitor Barcode Scanner SDK

### Out-of-the-box barcode scanning workflows

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK offers the following scan modes right out of the box in our ready-to-use UI:

#### Single Scanning

This is the Barcode Scanner SDK's default scanning mode. It is optimized for detecting a single barcode and is easily configurable to your needs. You can show a confirmation screen that displays detected barcode data.

#### Batch & Multi Scanning

The barcode scanner can also be configured to scan multiple barcodes in succession (without closing the scanning screen every time), to capture multiple barcodes from the camera view at once, or to count the scanned items.

#### Find & Pick

Given one or more barcodes, the Barcode Scanner SDK will visually highlight and scan the correct items for your users. It automatically selects the barcode with the right barcode value from your camera feed.

### AR Overlay

The Scanbot Capacitor Barcode Scanner plugin includes an optional AR Overlay for all scanning modes. It provides real-time barcode highlighting, preview, and tap-to-select functionalities. This can, for example, be used to display in-view error messages.

Recognized barcodes are highlighted with a customizable frame and text, clearly distinguishing scanned from unscanned items. Users can select barcodes manually by tapping or instead rely on automatic selection.

### Scanning barcodes from an image

The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK also supports still images, enabling barcode scanning from JPG and other image files. It supports single-image and multi-image detection and returns a list with the recognized barcodes.

### Supported barcodes

The Scanbot Capacitor barcode scanner library supports all common 1D- or 2D barcode formats, such as QR codes, or Aztec Codes, as well as multiple postal symbologies, including:

| Barcode type       | Barcode symbologies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
